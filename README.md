# delivery_app

- The purpose of the project is to develop a delivery app similar to Talabat.
- The app will allow users to:
  1. browse through a list of restaurants.
  2. place an order for food.
  3. track the delivery status in real-time (in the second version).
- The main goal is to provide a convenient and seamless experience for ordering food delivery. The app will feature an integrated payment system (in the second version), making it easy for users to place an order and pay for their food. The project aims to simplify the food ordering process and provide an alternative to traditional methods of ordering food.
